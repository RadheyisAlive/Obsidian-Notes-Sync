## Make a simple stack for me so that I can understand the concept of Stack in data structure

Yes, that's correct! "Stack" is a data structure concept or terminology, not a built-in function or class in Python.

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of a stack like a stack of plates: you add (push) new plates on top and remove (pop) the top plate first.

Here's a simple implementation of a stack using Python:

```Python

# Define a Stack class
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty list to store stack elements
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, item):
        # Add an item to the top of the stack
        self.stack.append(item)
        print(f"Item {item} pushed to the stack.")

    def pop(self):
        # Remove and return the top item from the stack
        if not self.is_empty():
            removed_item = self.stack.pop()
            print(f"Item {removed_item} popped from the stack.")
            return removed_item
        else:
            print("Stack is empty. Cannot pop an item.")
            return None

    def peek(self):
        # Return the top item without removing it
        if not self.is_empty():
            print(f"Top item is {self.stack[-1]}.")
            return self.stack[-1]
        else:
            print("Stack is empty. No top item to show.")
            return None

    def is_empty(self):
        # Check if the stack is empty
        return len(self.stack) == 0

    def size(self):
        # Return the number of items in the stack
        print(f"Stack size is {len(self.stack)}.")
        return len(self.stack)

# Example usage:
my_stack = Stack()

my_stack.push(10)  # Output: Item 10 pushed to the stack.
my_stack.push(20)  # Output: Item 20 pushed to the stack.
my_stack.push(30)  # Output: Item 30 pushed to the stack.

my_stack.peek()    # Output: Top item is 30.

my_stack.pop()     # Output: Item 30 popped from the stack.
my_stack.pop()     # Output: Item 20 popped from the stack.

my_stack.size()    # Output: Stack size is 1.

my_stack.pop()     # Output: Item 10 popped from the stack.
my_stack.pop()     # Output: Stack is empty. Cannot pop an item.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Push Operation:** Adds an item to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop Operation:** Removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek Operation:** Returns the item at the top without removing it.
4. **Is_Empty Method:** Checks if the stack has no elements.
5. **Size Method:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

This basic stack implementation will help you understand how a stack works and how it can be used in various applications such as undo operations in text editors or keeping track of function calls in recursion.

## what do stack store

A stack can store any type of data, depending on the implementation and use case. The most common data types stored in a stack include:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
    - **Integers:** For storing numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc.
    - **Floats:** For storing decimal numbers like 3.14, 2.718, etc.
    - **Characters:** For storing individual letters, symbols, etc.
    - **Booleans:** For storing true/false values.
2. **Complex Data Types:**
    - **Strings:** For storing sequences of characters like "hello", "world", etc.
    - **Lists/Arrays:** For storing multiple values in an ordered collection.
    - **Tuples:** For storing ordered collections of different data types.
    - **Dictionaries:** For storing key-value pairs.
3. **Custom Objects:**
    - You can store instances of custom classes or objects that you define in your code. This is useful in more complex applications, where you want to store objects with multiple attributes and methods.
4. **Pointers/References:**
    - In some languages, a stack can store references or pointers to other data structures or objects. This is common in languages like C/C++.

### Examples of Stack Usage:

1. **Expression Evaluation:** Storing operands and operators while evaluating mathematical expressions.
2. **Function Calls:** Storing function calls and their return addresses for recursive functions or during program execution.
3. **Undo Mechanisms:** Storing the previous states in applications (like text editors) to implement the undo feature.
4. **Balanced Parentheses:** Checking for balanced parentheses in expressions.

### Example in Python:

```Python
python
Copy code
# Stack storing different data types
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()
        else:
            return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

# Creating a stack instance
my_stack = Stack()

# Pushing different types of data onto the stack
my_stack.push(42)            # Integer
my_stack.push(3.14)          # Float
my_stack.push("hello")       # String
my_stack.push([1, 2, 3])     # List
my_stack.push({'a': 1, 'b': 2}) # Dictionary

# Popping elements and displaying them
print(my_stack.pop())  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
print(my_stack.pop())  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(my_stack.pop())  # Output: "hello"
print(my_stack.pop())  # Output: 3.14
print(my_stack.pop())  # Output: 42

```

In this example, the stack is capable of storing and handling different data types, and the `pop` method returns the elements in the reverse order they were added, demonstrating the LIFO behavior of stacks.
