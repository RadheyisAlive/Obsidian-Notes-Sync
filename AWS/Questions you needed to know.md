**Q3: A business analyst would like to move away from creating complex database queries and static spreadsheets when generating regular reports for high-level management. They would like to publish insightful, graphically appealing reports with interactive dashboards. Which service can they use to accomplish this?**

**A.** Amazon QuickSight

**B.** Business intelligence on Amazon Redshift

**C.** Amazon CloudWatch dashboards

**D.** Amazon Athena integrated with Amazon Glue

**Correct Answer – A**

**Explanation :**

Amazon QuickSight is the most appropriate service in the scenario.

QuickSight includes machine learning that allows users to discover inconspicuous trends and patterns on their datasets.

  

**Q6: A web administrator maintains several public and private web-based resources for an organisation. Which service can they use to keep track of the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates as well as updating and renewal?**

**A.** AWS Data Lifecycle Manager

**B.** AWS License Manager

**C.** AWS Firewall Manager

**D.** AWS Certificate Manager

**Correct Answer – D**

**Explanation :**

The AWS Certificate Manager allows the web administrator to maintain one or several SSL/TLS certificates, both private and public certificates including their update and renewal so that the administrator does not worry about the imminent expiry of certificates. [https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)

- **Option A is INCORRECT**. The AWS Lifecycle Manager creates life cycle policies for specified resources to automate operations. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/?id=docs_gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/?id=docs_gateway)
- **Option B is INCORRECT.** AWS License Manager serves the purpose of differentiating, maintaining third-party software provisioning vendor licenses. It also decreases the risk of license expirations and the penalties. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/?id=docs_gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/?id=docs_gateway)
- **Option C is INCORRECT.** AWS Firewall Manager aids in the administration of Web Application Firewall (WAF), by presenting a centralised point of setting firewall rules across different web resources. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/?id=docs_gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/?id=docs_gateway)
