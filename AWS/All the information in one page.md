### AWS Core Services and Concepts:

1. **Client-Server Model**: Interaction between clients (e.g., browsers) and servers (e.g., Amazon EC2).
2. **Deployment Models**: Cloud-based, on-premises, hybrid.
3. **Amazon EC2**: Compute capacity with instance types (general, compute, memory, storage optimized) and purchasing options (on-demand, reserved, spot).
4. **Auto Scaling & ELB**: Dynamic resource scaling; traffic distribution.

### Storage:

1. **Amazon S3**: Object storage with classes (Standard, IA, Glacier, Outposts).
2. **Amazon EBS**: Persistent block storage for single AZ.
3. **Amazon EFS**: Scalable file storage across AZs.

### Networking:

1. **Amazon VPC**: Isolated networks with public/private subnets, gateways, and ACLs (stateless) vs. security groups (stateful).
2. **Amazon Route 53**: DNS service, integrates with CloudFront for edge delivery.
3. **AWS Direct Connect & Snow Family**: Dedicated/private connections; physical data transfer.

### Databases:

1. **Amazon RDS & Aurora**: Relational database services.
2. **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL key-value database.
3. **Amazon Redshift**: Data warehouse.
4. **Amazon Neptune**: Graph database.
5. **Amazon QLDB & Managed Blockchain**: Ledger and blockchain services.
6. **Amazon ElastiCache & DAX**: Caching layers for databases.

### Compute:

1. **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions.
2. **Containers**: Amazon ECS, EKS, Fargate for orchestration.

### Machine Learning & Analytics:

1. **Amazon SageMaker**: End-to-end ML workflows.
2. **Amazon Comprehend, Personalize, Forecast**: NLP, recommendations, and time-series predictions.
3. **Amazon Athena & Timestream**: Serverless querying and time-series data.

### Security & Monitoring:

1. **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS (infrastructure) vs. Customer (data).
2. **AWS IAM**: User, roles, policies for access control.
3. **Amazon GuardDuty, Inspector, WAF**: Threat detection, security scanning, web firewall.
4. **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection (Standard, Advanced).
5. **CloudWatch & CloudTrail**: Monitoring and logging.
6. **AWS Artifact**: Compliance reports.

### Management:

1. **AWS Management Console, CLI, SDKs**: Interfaces for AWS access.
2. **CloudFormation & Elastic Beanstalk**: Infrastructure as code and simplified app deployment.
3. **AWS Systems Manager**: Operational insights and task automation.

### Cost and Support:

1. **Pricing Models**: Pay-as-you-go, reserved, volume discounts.
2. **AWS Cost Management**: Budgets, Cost Explorer, and Consolidated Billing.
3. **AWS Support Plans**: Basic to Enterprise, TAMs for advanced help.

### Miscellaneous:

1. **AWS Marketplace**: Software catalog.
2. **Migration Strategies**: Rehosting, replatforming, refactoring, repurchasing, retaining, retiring.
3. **Well-Architected Framework**: Six pillars (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, cost, sustainability).
