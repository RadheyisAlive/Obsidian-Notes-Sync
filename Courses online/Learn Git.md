first of all always use the documentation for learn git as a pro because there is a lot of commands

[https://git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)

Git is a software and git hub is a service.

Git lens is the extension that you can get in Visual studio code and that is amazing as it will give you the graphs for the files of the working directly.

## This is how you put a default code editor like vs code when you are using git

- - - wait is wirtten so it waits there for sometime till you save your changes

  

## what if you just created a new folder in a git reprository and it is not being tracked !!

Ah ha… I see the problem now…  Each folder has it’s own .git repository folder… so you need to initalise a new git repo in each of those new project folders. If you have no folders open with source control repos… you’ll be able to click on the + button and can initialise them that way. [image] Ot…  
DO GIT INIT THERE AGAIN  
  

  

## Know how it is very useful to use gitignore generator when you are dealing with thousands of files in git repos
