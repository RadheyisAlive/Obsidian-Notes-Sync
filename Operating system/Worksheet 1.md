### **1. What are the three main purposes of an Operating System?**

1. **To Provide an Environment for Program Execution:**
    
    - Acts as a bridge between the user and hardware, providing a safe and efficient environment for running applications.
    - Manages program execution, I/O operations, and system resources.
2. **To Simulate Features Not Available on Hardware:**
    
    - Creates virtual resources like virtual memory, file systems, and virtual machines.
    - Allows programs to use more memory than physically available by swapping data to disk.
3. **To Manage Hardware Resources Efficiently:**
    
    - Controls CPU scheduling, memory allocation, disk management, and I/O device management.
    - Ensures fair and efficient resource allocation among competing processes.

### **2. What is a multiprogramming system?**

- **Definition:**
    - A system that allows multiple programs to be loaded into memory and executed concurrently to maximize CPU utilization.

---

### **2. What is the main advantage of a multiprogramming system?**

- **Advantage:**
    - Increases CPU utilization by managing multiple tasks simultaneously.
    - Reduces idle time by executing another process while one waits for I/O.

---

### **2. How to achieve the main advantage of a multiprogramming system?**

- **Method:**
    - **Context Switching:** Saves the state of a process and loads another.
    - **Scheduling Algorithms:** Uses strategies like Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First.
    - **Efficient I/O Handling:** Overlaps I/O and CPU operations to prevent idle CPU time.

---

### **3. What is a time-sharing or multitasking system?**

- **Definition:**
    - An extension of multiprogramming that allows multiple users to interact with their programs simultaneously by rapidly switching tasks using time slices.

---

### **3. What is the main advantage of a time-sharing system?**

- **Advantage:**
    - Provides fast response times to users, making it efficient for multi-user environments.

---

### **3. How is a multitasking system typically implemented?**

- **Implementation:**
    - **Time Slicing:** Allocates small time intervals for each task.
    - **Context Switching:** Saves and loads process states efficiently.
    - **Timer Interrupts:** Ensures tasks do not monopolize CPU time.

---

### **3. Is multitasking possible without timer interrupts?**

- **Answer:**
    - No, preemptive multitasking requires timer interrupts to switch tasks at regular intervals.

---

### **4. What are the security problems in multiprogramming and time-sharing systems?**

- **Problems:**
    1. **Unauthorized Data Access:** Weak memory protection can lead to data leaks.
    2. **Resource Misuse:** Malicious users can monopolize resources, causing denial of service.
    3. **Privilege Escalation:** Poor separation of user and kernel modes can lead to unauthorized access.

---

### **4. Can we ensure the same degree of security as in dedicated machines?**

- **Answer:**
    - No, it is challenging due to shared resources. Enhanced security measures like access control, encryption, and sandboxing are needed.

---

### **5. An operating system is interrupt-driven. Explain this statement.**

- **Explanation:**
    - The OS relies on interrupts to handle asynchronous events efficiently.
    - The CPU stops current tasks to execute interrupt service routines and then resumes previous tasks.

---

### **6. What is a privileged instruction?**

- **Definition:**
    - Instructions that can only be executed in kernel mode to securely manage system resources (e.g., I/O operations, memory management).

---

### **6. How do computer hardware and OS support privileged instructions?**

- **Support Method:**
    - **Dual-Mode Operation:**
        - **User Mode:** Restricted access to prevent unauthorized actions.
        - **Kernel Mode:** Full access for executing privileged instructions.

---

### **6. What would happen if a user-mode process tries to execute a privileged instruction?**

- **Answer:**
    - The CPU triggers a **trap** to the OS, which handles the unauthorized action, usually terminating the process or denying access.

---

### **7. Which of the following instructions should be privileged? Explain why.**

|**Instruction**|**Privileged?**|**Reason**|
|---|---|---|
|**Set value of timer**|Yes|Prevents monopolization of CPU time.|
|**Read the clock**|No|Does not affect security or stability.|
|**Clear memory**|Yes|Prevents unauthorized data deletion.|
|**Turn-off interrupts**|Yes|Ensures critical tasks are not interrupted maliciously.|
|**Switch to monitor mode**|Yes|Prevents unauthorized kernel access.|
|**Modify base and limit registers**|Yes|Ensures memory protection.|
|**Issue a trap instruction**|No|Allows safe interaction with the OS.|
|**Access I/O device**|Yes|Controls hardware access securely.|
|**Modify device-status table**|Yes|Ensures accurate status reporting.|

---

### **8. What is the purpose of system calls?**

- **Purpose:**
    - Provide a controlled mechanism for user programs to request services from the OS kernel securely.

---

### **8. Describe three methods to pass parameters of a system call to the OS.**

4. **Using Registers:**
    - Efficient for passing small amounts of data directly.
5. **Using Stack:**
    - Parameters are pushed onto the stack before the call, offering flexibility for larger data.
6. **Using Memory Blocks:**
    - Passes a pointer to a memory block containing parameters, suitable for complex data.

---

### **9. Give examples of Unix System Calls for each of the following categories:**

|**Category**|**Examples**|
|---|---|
|**Process Control**|`fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`.|
|**File Manipulation**|`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`.|
|**Device Manipulation**|`ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`.|
|**Information Maintenance**|`getpid()`, `alarm()`, `sleep()`.|
|**Communications**|`pipe()`, `socket()`, `shmget()`.|
