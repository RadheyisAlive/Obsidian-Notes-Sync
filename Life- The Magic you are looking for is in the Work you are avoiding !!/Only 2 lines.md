rules(only two lines and if wanna write on some topic then just write it in red no other color used in)

26-04-2-2024

If you donâ€™t write any aims for the day you are at least not Conscious of the aims and time for that day so always write aims and keep them small, I recommend keeping doable for a day very easily.

27-04-2024

Bro your decision power is missing still, close your eyes and then ask should I do it or not ??, if no then fuck no, no matter who is it, clear the brain fog, no tension for PR, straight hustle/meditation.

28-04-2024

Bro If aims not finish and is not able to finish because of some reasons then change it and dont settle till you have done for the day, dont do time waste its your 20s

29-04-2024

Bro there is a problem with your sleep, make sure you get effective sleep block if needed, second thing if aims(doable) not completed then block mobile for at least 10 hrs, 5 each or 5 hrs

30-04-2024

Good till now, but set time frames and fuck tasks, tasks related breaks not time related breaks

01-05-2024

Set a time to sit continuously for a target and sit continuously for that target and everything later, sleep or any shit like food and stuff but keep that in mind that complete in time frame !!

02-05-2024

Couldnt control mood and played bgmi, bro till aim not finished ,,,, **calls, or mood or whatever bring it no matter what, you know how !!** **FC etc dude manage until your aim(small aim)**

03-04-2024

The thing if not getting to study just do things that lets you start like **FC or Meditation** just sit again if failed to do, but you do M or sleep or bgmi or eat or search for movies but just this two things

04-04-2024

07-04-2024

Fucked up slept all day, 2 things **1) If slept enough and still sleepy or sleeping always that means you are engaged to studies enough, enjoy it speak and study or music may be you know how !!**

08-04-2024

(07-05-2024)2)If feeling M or searching for M realize this that either your karma is not done or doing else your power is increasing to get ruthless stand up and up it becuase it is limited to a age.

nah Dont Stop writing Aims for the, the first thing in the morning is this work, Dont leave it now

18-05-2024

See how is time passing !! because you come after job and how come you get only free just after 9 hrs, insta(2 hrs), sleep(3hrs), Talking in Zeelâ€™s room(1 to 2 hrs), (1 hrs bath or Pee stuff),(1 hrs calls)

19-04-2024

If you wanna get productivity on your desk then you have to go into that deep focus with the doable aims that you have got !! Instead you just sit and study whatever, bro 1.5 hrs no distractðŸ‘ˆ

20-04-2024

1. Never leave any day bro and if left then dont destroy everything in regret the First thing that you have to do in the morning is to write your aims.

21-04-2024

1. **I will focus on my own benefits and goals daily, not considering anyone else's until it benefits me. Don't let others live your dream life!**

22-04-2024

1. Buy anything but first look and think about it donâ€™t directly use your card instantly. And don' be a fool, first rule write the price in the page and then buy it, Aims till 2025 Jan leave everything !!

23-05-2024

First thing in Morning or whenever you are conscious set yourself the aims of the day otherwise you are in probability of loosing that day.

29-05-2024

Look at how many days you do your doable aims and you actually write a review for the work done!

and if cannot study then no matter make a discipline to prove this ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡through meditation!!

30-05-2024

yes come in that mode that you will complete all the doable aims no matter what. Until you start you just have to meditate and tell your self that there is nothing else other than doing that shit !!

31-05-2024

If you just put 4 hrs by 2 hrs+25 min break and take this very seriously then you dont need anything else to solve life and consistency

1-05-2024

==**Legendary trick**== is whenever you are not studying or whatever cant study then just do one thing wake up in the deep morning to study nothing else, I am sure you will study, sleep early for that!!

07-05-2024

just speak and study !! that all you want to study in focus !!

18-06-2024

any day anything can be a hyptonizer to ya so be careful !!

07-07-2024

today I have seen that store your personal stuff in one drive personal account and then you can store you every other not personal kind of data in your work one drive !!

14-07-2024

yes continuous sitting is missing and more over if got control over it then I realized that continuous sitting can spend your day which can always save you from relapsing M, but all going good till now!!
