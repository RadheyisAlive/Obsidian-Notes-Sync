# Or the Factors that I encounter whenever I have a study session that I am always looking for !!

1. Whenever I talk to myself or speak and study then I can work for long hours and more productive too !!
2. just type fast !! Very fast !!
3. Bgm only from Rise nothing else !!
4. Don’t put a timer, or put it, be aim oriented or sometimes not just don’t get bored by it !!
5. Use tricks to study like Pomodoro or focus timers I don’t mind !!

# What makes you sit to study !!

1. Just try to look at the syllabus or find a meaning to sit in front of your laptop for a second which gives a chance to open your study session !!
2. Just sit and write the targeted aims, that is the best method !!
3. First and best way is to write the aims for the day and just sit to complete it !!

# Hypnotizers !!

- I have noticed one thing that when you just do a thing with just full potential like you did to learn touch typing in your keyboard, you can achieve the thing faster than the consistency can get it!! so just start whenever you can is the key !! you can also achieve that thing in a short amount of time !!

- [ ] Movies(Sifra- teri batoo me aisa aulja)

the method to achieve this !! The is the way to practice intelligently

- Deconstruct the skills - what can you achieve if I invest my time to achieve this skill !!
- Learn to self correct - Get sources and analyze it in that extent that you can self correct
- Remove practice barriers - Remove distraction not only physical like TV but the barrier of frustration, if couldn’t do it then gets the feeling of frustration !!
- Practice at least 20 hrs - We don’t like to feel stupid, and that is the barrier to actually sit and give 20 hrs. Not research its practice right keep the difference,

my research says that research would maximumly take 2 to 3 hrs that’s all !!
