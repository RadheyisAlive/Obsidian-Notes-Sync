Bro one thing I found out every day you waste a lot of time writing your life, the same thing you did in IIT mate, no need to write Life down, you never read it or remember it until it becomes your lifestyle thought and lifestyle life or rules, there is no impact if you don’t remember it in your lifestyle, writing means nothing, instead if you can think the same things regularly so you can remember it too for your lifestyle, so stop writing life down and act some peculiar actions like studying, last time you wasted 1 hr of this shitty whatever work. ==**THE MORE KARMA MORE MONEY MANAGEMENT, HAPPINESS, SUCESS RATE, HEALTH EVERYTHING**==

  

==Yes I believe in IIT now, even the perplexity AI owner is Arvind Srinivas who is from IIT, so one thing wanna become at that point just become an IItian, you know how !! Think as you have mastered the hectic schedule of JEE preparation !!==

[[Study Tricks]]

[[Big Money decisions]]

  

==**I ask you only this Things In your life**==

  

- [ ] ==**Every day I will complete my aims that is doable and self made No matter what**==
- [ ] ==**Every day 10 to 30 minutes of running or walking or meditating no matter what**==
- [ ] ==**Always sleep through podcasts or reading no matter what that should be a habit**==
- [ ] ==**If made a wrong decision get out of there no matter whoever gets hurt from it but get out of there, close your eyes and think because Decisions makes your day(M is not a thing)(Closed eyes method is your life dude)**==
- [ ] ==**Try to Wash your face before sleep (recommended more) and take care of your visual of body. I wanna be seen not the bitches**==

  

do this every single day and see the difference, every other thing in the character will come around this things

  

Read this to Yourself every fuckin day no matter what with your aims

  

- CED, if realized that making wrong decisions please for god sake stop right there, will only happen if you ask yes or no, if no then sharply no means no….
- just make a habit if not studying or not in mood then don't go to other distractions and pass the time, just isolate yourself to just meditation or FC that is the thing to develop, it will help you to sit back and once you learn how to sit back then mate you are learning consistency.
- Punishment is needed for Discipline, If aim not completed but it was doable(means you wasted time instead of CLD and saying no to it) bhai no matter cover karish tane sala, lock everything if needed, be Stone rigid for it … dont care about anything next day this is the way to get things done actually and get the discipline you wanna make,
- Nap only happens on the chair and table no where else !! Have sleep or not decide that, Moreover in Alarms ask that want to sleep or wanna wake up ,don’t put 20 min timer again its Fuckin ridiculous. Remember NAP ONLY OCCURS ON CHAIR AKA TABLE NO WHERE ELSE !
- If feeling Sleepy or M——→

**1)If slept enough but still sleepy or sleeping always that means you are not engaged to studies or life enough, enjoy it speak and study or music may be you know how !!**

**2)If feeling M or searching for M or thoughts, realized this that either your karma is not done or doing else your power is increasing to get ruthless stand up and use it because it is limited to an age. Once you have done hell hard work you will not remember it when you are having fun but the fun will increase itself.**

**3) Deciding sleep never gives M feeling if slept with podcasts and Actual Sleep music or reading, improve your sleep or sleeping method its very important which you mess up every time!!**

**IF wanna sleep for one hr or more than it 6 hrs, then must slept by any sleep music especially or podcast or reading, nothing is better than that, you cant sleep by M every time in wrong hrs and for wrong duration(It does gives you wrong duration of time to sleep because of very deep sleep) !!**

  

- Not true
    
    ==When ever there is a problem in Consistency or Productivity== come in Uni and no matter what dont decide to go back you eat here you will waste some amount of money here and at home too, not because of the students, its because there is no Cozy bed to sleep in, naps will only happen on the Desk !!, and yes if determined to study for 2 hrs and 20 min break then it can happen !! This is 100-hour work weeks bro !!
    
      
    

☝️

  

**if the doable aim is finished then you can enjoy !! or set things more and get credit !!**

**==Imagine you already crossed your progress and completed all certificates and doing an intern !! how much confidence will it give you !!==**

  

Bro if Wasted time in Mobile or wrong decision that will waste your hours and not finish the AIM even then the phone will get blocked by yourself, not blockers of course !!

Remember this too, if aim is not covered by Wasting time I will sleep only if 2 hrs left for the next day starting only then dude till then no sleep only study or finish your work, yeah but still atleast look at plan for tomorrow don’t get fucked for that rule !!

  

Why do you headache occurs when you study for long hrs??

- Breaking neurons of other habits !!
- Tension because of not studying !!
- Too much sleep, sleeping till 6 pm is bad luck
- Or Have a nap, Nap only occurs on the sitting chair !!
- Not engaging in Studies —>Speak and studies
- Not fresh FC or Bath
- Just not completing the aim—→ Try library and no matter what 2hrs and 20 min break and determined to the plan and priority !!
- Music Maybe !!
- Just Feel that your hardwork doesn’t matter till you have not finished your work and during fun it is not remembered !!

  

**REMEMBER THIS MATE FOR NEXT SEMESTER IF YOUR CLASSES IS PASSING AND YOU ARE MAKING A PILE OF IT, REMEMBER IT WILL FUCK YOU VERY HARD, I MEAN VERY VERY HARD, YOU WILL DEFINITELY GET FUCKED WITH THAT DEED, DOSENT MATTER IF YOU ARE NOT COMPLETING THE THE CLASSES AND ITS WORK REGULARLY, BETA YOU TO GONE, SAME IN IIT, SAME IN FOP, IF COULDN’T COME TO UNI AND THEN DO IT, COME AFTER MORNINGS OR WHATEVER BUT IF COULDNT COMPLETE THAT WORK REGULARLY AT HOME OR WHERE EVER, GET READY FOR IT, IT WILL BE VERY HARD, VERY VERY HARD !! FOP was like nightmare for me !!**

  

REMEMBER THIS YOU LEFT ONE WEEK FIRST AND THEN AFTER NOT COMPLETING THAT ONE WEEK STUFF YOU LEFT THE SECOND AND THIRD WEEK AGAIN WHICH INDEED PUT PRESSURE FOR WEEK 4 AND NOT ONLY IN ONE UNIT YOU DID IT FOR MORE THAN ONE UNIT, ONLY BECAUSE OF THAT YOU ARE LEFT BEHIND ITS NOTING THAT IT IS HARD OR NOT BELONG TO YOU, FOR EXAMPLE THE MILESTONES AND MAKE A FLOW OF IT YOU DID IT IN WORKSHOP AT LEAST YOU GOT AN IDEA BUT IN GIT YOU LEFT THE WORKSHOP THEN OF COURSE HOW WILL YOU KNOW HOW TO WORKK BY GitHub IN ASSIGNMENTS THEN, eh?? MOREOVER THEN THE WORK DOUBLES OR TRIPLES

TENSION

NO TUTORS OR MATES TO EXPLAIN OR DOUBT CLEARANCE

UPCOMING LECTURES AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ALL FOUR UNITS

THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD IF YOU DO ALL ASSIGNMENTS ANS UNIT WORK AND WORKSHOPS(lectures before workshops to properly understand it, then by god there is no power to conquer you)

  

  

Simple thing if consistency is not coming then come to uni, set a target and no matter what try to complete it !! you know how to isolate if not in mood or you know what is mood now so come on be it !!

  

Stress and backlog

  

# IIT Passed, Same way Bachelors Degree will pass, and so will your youth, Change can happen in just 1 to 3 Months, Assurance of Consistency can happen in just 1- 3 Days, Stop it for just more than Once, No matter, fail again, Sit back again, Failing is always better than not trying, you just need a start of consistency and discipline, which will work then days→months→year→Sucess

understand the power of these words, just try to succeed this moment so as to win today, which will succeed tomorrow and the day after, which will bring a month or two,,, just give yourself some months, you will yourself not ask to go back again…..you know I have practiced consistency before!!

Consistency is when you stop doing what you're not supposed to do for the first time….because first time is what matters and which will start consistency again !!

Change can happen in a second if you are willing to flip the switch !!

A bigger mistake is to dwell on regrets instead of moving past them and starting again. Get outa that situation and do what will thrive you because…

## I leant true happiness is when thriving in **your** life nothing else !!

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Actually just 2 things keep in mind

  

- If you wanna leave M then only, Nope this is not the option actually which is written in toggle list, actually follow your karma no matter what, make that discipline !!
    
    searching for it if you block it so that no searching is provided, hmm why?? So If Started searching or got a hand Of it, you will get a treat since you will not do it much more, if got it, then directly stopping it will give you a treat, but it searching only 2 dollars treat !! and 5 for the bigger achievement !!
    
    searching to get a way is more time waste then watching and get done with it !!
    
      
    

  

About Blocking !!

P block is good, same thing if you block something for a time, or like focus modes, you just waste time more(wait) for it to finish and then do your time waste, it’s like you still search for P even if you have blocked it from somewhere and try to find a way to get it and that time waste is a bigger time waste because you don’t settle till you have found it !! So never put focus mode ,just put th ephone away just delete the apps if its social media and only only block if it is extreme like BGMI with Inder because it takes at lease 1 to 2 hrs to play bgmi which is not very good to devote your time there !! s**o never block if its not intense like bgmi !!**

  

  

[[Only 2 lines]]

If there is a time frame in a task and you are tensed about it because it has a due near by, then you will mess up the whole situation bro, you wont just feel to sit and study,,,,Then just one thing go run to a library or sleep a fat sleep if feeling sleepy like 1 to 2 hrs, and more over i have seen that in that situation you dont get into studying actually like speaking and studying but you just feel tired in this situation the thing is just fat sleep, go where others study too !! 👇👇

### No not even this, at the end of the day it doesn't matter bro just discipline matters, just realized it again !!

**or only try meditation or sleep or study with me or think about the situation if complex like VM is not working or just start studying with full energy (speaking with yourself during study matters, background music matters, Study with me online or offline live or rnot matters, Standing and studying matters, an coffee matters, 1-2 hrs sleep matters too ), But dont get into movie or bgmi or just mobile because it will feel good for an hr or two but later things will be more stressfull !!** ==**Just try to sit with the energy of speaking and studying !!**==

**so just one thing you are not doing if you dont wanna study,, 👇👇**

**you are not engaging in studies so speak and Study or**

**meditate or the best FC or**

**sleep for an perfect hr or**

**just get yourself to studying or**

**try this is the best take a bath and sit back studying in dark with space music or just after bath or**

**coffee or cold drink or**

**Library or**

**Study with your friend or**

**(just get yourself to study with the energy of speaking with studying and not deviating) instead of doing games with friends or movies or reels to get mood**
