No worries! Let's break it down in simpler terms without going too deep into the "bit" concepts.

### What is a Subnet?

A **subnet** is like dividing a big street (network) into smaller streets (subnets) so that traffic (data) can flow more easily and the network is more organized.

Imagine you have an area with **256 houses** (IP addresses) in one neighborhood (network). But you don't need all 256 houses to be used at once, so you decide to break it into two smaller neighborhoods of **128 houses** each.

### The Key Parts of an IP Address

An IP address is like an address on the street. Let's take a simple example of an **IP address**: `192.168.1.0`. This represents a whole neighborhood.

When you break that big neighborhood into smaller ones, you're subnetting. For example, you could split it into two parts:

- **First Neighborhood (subnet):** `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.127`
- **Second Neighborhood (subnet):** `192.168.1.128` to `192.168.1.255`

In subnetting, the **subnet mask** tells us where to split.

### What is a Subnet Mask?

A **subnet mask** is a special code that tells the network what part of the IP address is the "neighborhood" (network) part and what part is the "house" (host) part.

- If you have a **subnet mask** like `255.255.255.0`, it means the first part (`192.168.1`) is the **network**, and the last part (`0`) represents the **houses** (or devices) in the network.
- You can change the subnet mask to split the houses into different neighborhoods.

### Real-Life Analogy:

- Imagine a street with 256 houses, and you want to organize it into smaller blocks. Each block can have 128 houses.
- You change the "rule" of how houses are numbered to divide the big street into two smaller streets (subnets).

### Simple Example:

1. You have the IP address `192.168.1.0`.
2. Using the subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, this means you have one large neighborhood with **256 houses** (IPs).
3. You split it into two smaller neighborhoods by using a different mask (e.g., `255.255.255.128`):
    - **First smaller neighborhood:** `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.127`
    - **Second smaller neighborhood:** `192.168.1.128` to `192.168.1.255`

### Summary:

- **Subnetting** means dividing a big network into smaller parts (subnets).
- A **subnet mask** helps us determine where to make that split (what part of the IP address is for the network and what part is for the devices).
- Each subnet is like a smaller neighborhood, with its own range of IP addresses for devices.

I hope this makes more sense now! Let me know if you'd like further clarification.
A **subnet** (short for **subnetwork**) is a logically segmented portion of a larger network, created by dividing the network into smaller, more manageable pieces. Subnetting allows a network administrator to divide an IP network into smaller subnetworks, which can improve network performance, security, and efficient use of IP addresses.

### Key Points to Understand Subnets:

1. **IP Address Structure:**
    
    - An **IP address** is made up of two parts: the **network** part and the **host** part.
    - The **network part** identifies the specific network or subnet.
    - The **host part** identifies a specific device (e.g., computer, router) within that network.
2. **Subnet Mask:**
    
    - A **subnet mask** defines which portion of the IP address is the network and which portion is the host.
    - The subnet mask contains a series of `1`s in the network portion, followed by `0`s in the host portion. For example, `255.255.255.0` is a common subnet mask, where the first 24 bits represent the network and the remaining 8 bits represent hosts.
3. **How Subnets Work:**
    
    - Subnetting splits a large network into smaller networks. This helps to manage IP addresses efficiently and isolate network traffic within the subnets.
    - For example, if you have a network with the address `192.168.1.0/24`, subnetting can divide it into smaller subnets like `192.168.1.0/25`, `192.168.1.128/25`, etc.
4. **Benefits of Subnetting:**
    
    - **Efficient IP address usage:** Instead of assigning a large block of IP addresses to a single network, subnetting allows smaller chunks to be assigned where needed.
    - **Network organization:** It can improve network security and performance by limiting broadcast traffic within each subnet.
    - **Easier management:** Smaller subnets are easier to manage, and troubleshooting is more isolated.
5. **Example:**
    
    - Consider an IP address `192.168.1.10` with a subnet mask `255.255.255.0`. Here, `192.168.1.0/24` represents the network, and `10` is a host in that network.
    - If you want to break this into two subnets, you can change the subnet mask to `255.255.255.128` (or `/25`), which will divide the network into two smaller subnets: `192.168.1.0/25` (for the first half of the IP range) and `192.168.1.128/25` (for the second half).

### Visualizing Subnetting:

- A **/24** subnet means that the first 24 bits are for the network and the remaining 8 bits are for the host. This allows up to 256 addresses, where 254 can be used by devices (one address for the network and one for the broadcast).
- A **/25** subnet means 25 bits for the network and 7 bits for the host, resulting in two subnets, each with 128 addresses.

In short, **subnetting** helps break down large networks into smaller segments, making them easier to manage, more secure, and more efficient.

### This the meaning of /24 bits and /25 bits
Great! Now that the subnetting concept is clearer, let's dive into what the **/24** and **/25** mean.

These are **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation, and it's a shorthand way to represent a **subnet mask**.

### What is **/24** and **/25**?

- The **number after the slash (/)** indicates how many bits are used for the **network part** of the IP address.
    
    - **/24** means that the first **24 bits** of the IP address are used for the network.
    - **/25** means that the first **25 bits** of the IP address are used for the network.

### Let's break it down:

#### 1. **/24** Notation

- **/24** is the same as the subnet mask `255.255.255.0`.
    
- In binary form, it looks like this:
    
    ```
    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
    ```
    
- This means the **first 24 bits** (the ones) are used to identify the network, and the **remaining 8 bits** (the zeros) are used for the host (individual devices) in that network.
    
- **For example**:
    
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.0/24`
    - Network: `192.168.1.0`
    - Host Range: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254` (this range can be used by devices).
    - Broadcast Address: `192.168.1.255`
    
    **So**, `/24` means you have **256 IP addresses** (including network and broadcast addresses), where 254 addresses can be used for devices (hosts).
    

#### 2. **/25** Notation

- **/25** is the same as the subnet mask `255.255.255.128`.
    
- In binary form, it looks like this:
    
    ```
    11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000
    ```
    
- This means the **first 25 bits** are used for the network, and the **remaining 7 bits** are used for the host.
    
- **For example**:
    
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.0/25`
    - Network: `192.168.1.0`
    - Host Range: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.126` (hosts).
    - Broadcast Address: `192.168.1.127`
    
    **So**, `/25` means you now have **128 IP addresses** (including network and broadcast addresses), where 126 addresses can be used for devices.
    

### Summary:

- **/24** = `255.255.255.0` → 256 addresses in the network (254 usable for devices).
- **/25** = `255.255.255.128` → 128 addresses in the network (126 usable for devices).

The smaller the number after the slash, the **larger the subnet** and the more devices it can accommodate. For example, **/24** allows for more devices than **/25**.
