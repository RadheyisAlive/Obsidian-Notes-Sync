basic knowledge of what data types store â€”

the formula is (2^n -1) where n is bits assigned to that data type

for example int datatype stores 4 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits and so (2^32-1)

so **int**: Commonly 4 bytes (32 bits). Can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (signed) or 0 to 4,294,967,295 (unsigned).
