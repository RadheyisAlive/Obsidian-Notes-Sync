Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different rates. Data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth. Bandwidth is the capacity at which a medium can carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps).

4.2.6 Bandwidth Terminology

Terms used to measure the quality of bandwidth include:

- Latency
-Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
- Throughput
-Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.
Due to a number of factors, throughput usually does not match the specified bandwidth in physical layer implementations. Throughput is usually lower than the bandwidth. There are many factors that influence throughput:

The amount of traffic
The type of traffic
The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

- Goodput
-There is a third measurement to assess the transfer of usable data; it is known as goodput. Goodput is the measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time.
