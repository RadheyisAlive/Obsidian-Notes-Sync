Certainly! Here's the full question with the explanation:

### Question:

**Which organization defines standards for the network access layer (i.e., the OSI physical and data link layers)?**

- Cisco
- IANA
- IEEE
- IETF

### Correct Answer:

**IEEE**

### Explanation:

- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)** is the organization responsible for creating standards for the **network access layer** of the OSI model, which includes the **physical layer** and the **data link layer**.
- The **network access layer** defines the specifications for physical transmission media (such as cables, connectors, and signals) and protocols for data framing and addressing, which are crucial for communication at the local level in a network.
- IEEE is well-known for its **802 standards**, such as **IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)**, which outlines how Ethernet works in both the **physical** and **data link** layers of the OSI model.

### Other options:

- **Cisco**: Cisco is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells networking hardware and software. While it implements and supports industry standards, it does not define them.
- **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)**: IANA is responsible for managing global IP address allocation and the domain name system (DNS) but does not define the physical or data link layer standards.
- **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**: IETF is an organization that works on internet standards, particularly in higher layers of the OSI model, such as the **transport layer** (e.g., TCP) and **application layer** (e.g., HTTP), but it is not focused on the physical or data link layers.

**Question 3:**  
Which type of VLAN is assigned to 802.1Q trunk ports to carry untagged traffic?

- [ ]  Default
- [ ]  Native
- [ ]  Data
- [ ]  Management

**Solution:** Native. The native VLAN carries untagged traffic over 802.1Q trunk ports.
