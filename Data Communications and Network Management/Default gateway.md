A default gateway is ==the IP address of a router that acts as the "exit point" for network traffic destined for networks outside your local network, like the internet==. It's the path used when a device doesn't know the specific route to a destination. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

- **What it does:**
    
    When a device on your network (e.g., your computer, phone, or smart TV) wants to send data to a device on another network (e.g., a website on the internet), it doesn't know the exact path to that destination. 
    
- **The router's role:**
    
    The default gateway, which is usually the IP address of your router, is the device that handles this routing. 
    
- **How it works:**
    
    Your device sends the data to the default gateway, which then forwards it to the appropriate network or internet destination. 
    
- **Why it's important:**
    
    Without a default gateway, devices on your network wouldn't be able to communicate with devices outside of your local network. 
    
- **Finding your default gateway:**
    
    You can usually find your default gateway address by looking at your network settings on your computer or phone, or by checking your router's IP address. 
    
- **Example:**
    
    Imagine you're browsing the internet. Your computer sends a request to a website (which is on a different network). Your computer doesn't know how to get to that website directly, so it sends the request to your router (your default gateway), which then knows how to forward the request to the correct network.
