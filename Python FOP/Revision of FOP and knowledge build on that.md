The `random` package in Python provides various functions for generating random numbers, selecting random elements, and shuffling sequences. Here are a few commonly used functions:

---

### **1. Generate a Random Integer (`randint`)**

Generates a random integer **between two numbers (inclusive)**.

```python
import random
print(random.randint(1, 100))  # Random number between 1 and 100
```

---

### **2. Generate a Random Floating-Point Number (`uniform`)**

Generates a **random float** between two numbers.

```python
print(random.uniform(1.5, 5.5))  # Random float between 1.5 and 5.5
```

---

### **3. Generate a Random Float Between 0 and 1 (`random`)**

Generates a **random float between 0 and 1**.

```python
print(random.random())  # Example output: 0.3742
```

---

### **4. Choose a Random Element from a List (`choice`)**

Selects a **random item from a list**.

```python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
print(random.choice(colors))  # Example output: "blue"
```

---

### **5. Choose Multiple Random Elements (`sample`)**

Selects **multiple unique items** from a list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(random.sample(numbers, 3))  # Example output: [7, 2, 5]
```

---

### **6. Shuffle a List (`shuffle`)**

Randomly **shuffles the order of elements** in a list.

```python
cards = ["Ace", "King", "Queen", "Jack"]
random.shuffle(cards)
print(cards)  # Example output: ['Queen', 'Ace', 'King', 'Jack']
```

---

### **7. Generate a Random Boolean (`getrandbits`)**

Generates **True or False** randomly.

```python
print(bool(random.getrandbits(1)))  # Example output: True
```
