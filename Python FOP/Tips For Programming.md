- In range Loop !! —→

Loops usually go from 0 to maximum-1 to have maximum iterations. If we shift the start up by 1, we also have to shift the stop value by 1.  
  
`for i in range(1, int(num_iter) + 1 ):`

  

- += ——→ x += 3 so the thing is x = x+3
    
    x /= 3 then the thing is x = x/ 3
    
    same with * and - operators
    
      
    
- Lists are quite similar to range funtion

if there is ( , ,-1) ———> the start in this is -1 and end is till the value can go so same in Lists to print the string in reverse we can do like [ , ,-1] the start here is -1 and the end is till the length of the string Goes….

  

- x ! = y gives true if x≠y

  

  

- bucket.insert(5, ‘Radhey’) ——> so insert() function inserts the string in the given Index

  

  

- RANDIT FUNCTION
    
      
    

What does random Randint do in Python?

Basically, the randint() method in Python **returns a random integer value between the two lower and higher limits (including both limits) provided as two parameters**. we can use it as random.randint()

so in random extention we are calling randit() function

  

  

- RANDOM FUNCTION

  

The random() method **returns a random floating number between 0 and 1**.

What is the purpose of the random function?

The RANDOM function returns a numeric value that is a pseudo-random number  
(one of a sequence of numbers generated by an algorithm so as to have an  
even distribution over a range of values and minimal correlation  
between successive values) from a rectangular distribution.

- Sometimes float data type can give false out because it can be very precise and can be only shown till two points in an array so if compared looks same but can be different

- WE have to put ; only in this not on else where like random.randint()

- Time Library !!

> [!info] What is the Time Library in Python? A Helpful Guide  
> Time library in Python is part of the Python Standard Library that provides various functions to work with time-related operations.

- As long as i is Not overlapping somewhere we can use i in as many range as we want !!
